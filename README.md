# Stack

This project implements a stack in C++.
All stack operations can be done using a dynamic array, 
so we will use C++'s dynamic array, `std::vector`.

Stacks are LIFO (Last In First Out), and will include
the methods:

* `push(int value)` - adds the given value to the top of the stack. 
* `pop()` - removes and returns the item on top of the stack. 
* `peek()` - returns the item on top of the stack without removal. 
* `isEmpty()` - bool for whether stack is empty.
